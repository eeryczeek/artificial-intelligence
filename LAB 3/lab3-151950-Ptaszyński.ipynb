In a sense, we were more interested in the *journey* rather than in the *destination* itself: our goal was to transform the initial state to the goal state, not to construct the goal state from scratch. Local search is also different from tree/graph search algorithms like A*: it assumes that all intermediate states are acceptable, but they differ in their quality and the goal is to find the best solution."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"K5kvLgZ_dJZ5"},"source":["We will reuse the definition of the class `Problem` from earlier, but extend it with a new function: `cost`, returning a number representing the cost of the state given as its argument `state`. We want to minimize the cost, so the lower the number the better the state. We make no assumptions about the cost being non-negative, i.e., there may be states with a negative cost (i.e., a gain) - such an approach enables us to consider both maximization and minimization problems within a single framework. We also replace the property `intial_state` with the funtion `random_state` which is supposed to return a randomly generated state for the problem. Finally, we remove `is_goal`, as there may be no clear goal definition."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"id":"q4OBJeeHdJZ5","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1668005030557,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":24,"user":{"displayName":"Eryk","userId":"06461886407302871561"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["class Problem:\n","    def random_state(self):\n","        ...\n","        \n","    def available_actions(self, state):\n","        ...        \n","        \n","    def do_action(self, state, action):\n","        ...\n","        return new_state\n","        \n","    def cost(self, state) -> float:\n","        ..."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Sk1EepppdJZ7"},"source":["Throughout this assignment we will be using a pseudo-random number generator.
