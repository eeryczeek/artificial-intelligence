`policy`. Their purpose is to approximate the function $Q(s,a)$, but in a somewhat special way: an input of a model is the current state `s` and the outputs are the values of $Q(s, a)$ for each possible action.\n","\n","The explanation why there are two models is a bit complicated: recall that in the Q-learning algorithm the agent updates $Q(s,a)$ to the value of $r+\\gamma \\max_{a'} Q(s', a')$ (where $r$ stands for a reward received after transitioning from $s$ to $s'$ using the action $a$). Now, should we use the same network to approximate both the current value $Q(s,a)$ and the target value $r+\\gamma \\max_{a'} Q(s', a')$ it would mean that changing the parameters of the network changes both the current value $Q(s,a)$ and the target value, which is perhaps rather unfortunate. Instead, we use an off-line copy of the network to compute the target value and perdiocially (and rather rarely) update it by copying the parameters of the on-line network to the off-line network. \n","\n","In the code below the variable `policy` represents the on-line model which is used to compute $Q(s,a)$ and `target` represents the off-line model used to compute $Q(s',a')$ in the target value. Both models have an identical structure defined by the function `create_model` and the call to the function `target.load_state_dict` ensures that both are initialized with exactly the same values of parameters.\n","\n","**Note**: Consider modifying the used model, e.g., remove `BatchNorm1d`, add/remove a layer, make a layer wider/narrower, change nonlinearity. These changes should not require substantial changes in the other parts of the code.
