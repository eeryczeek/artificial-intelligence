Of course, we limit ourselves to a very limited subset of games: two players, zero sum, perfect information, deterministic games. These properties may require some explanation:\n","\n","* *Two players* is pretty straightforward: there are exactly two players. Any less is a puzzle (see previous classes), any more is interesting (but out of scope).\n","* *Zero sum* means that a win of one player is necessarly a loss of the other player. For example, if one player wins the game having 100 points, the other player must have exactly -100 points.\n","* *Perfect information* means that there are no hidden variables in the game, like some cards kept in secret by players. Both players can see exactly the same thing.\n","* *Deterministic* means that there is no randomness in the game, no dices, no decks of cards, etc.\n","\n","Each and every of these assumptions can be relaxed, yielding a more complex variant of the problem of playing games."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"nHgkUdvxMS_S"},"source":["## Game\n","\n","We begin by defining a general class `Game`, equipped with 7 functions:\n","\n","* `initial_state` returns a representation of an intial state of the game, e.g., an empty board and an information which player plays first. State is opaque to search algorithms, similarly as in the classes on Agents and A*.\n","* `player` return the id of a player to make a move in the given `state`. Here we consistently use number 1 to represent the first player and 2 to represent the second player, but in general any two distict identifiers would suffice.\n","* `actions` returns a list of valid moves in the given state. This corresponds to the list of available actions in previous classes.\n","* `result` returns a new state after performing the given `action` in the given `state`. This is the transition model underpinning the game.\n","* `is_terminal` returns `True` if the given `state` is a terminal node in the search tree, i.e., either one of the players won or it is a draw. This is a leaf in a search tree and no further actions can be executed.\n","* `utility` can be called only for a terminal `state` and returns a numeric representation of how good this state is for the given `player`. Because we are considering zero-sum games it is always true that `utility(state, 1) = -utility(state, 2)`\n","* `print_state` is a helper function to pretty-print the given `state` to the standard output. As the representation is opaque and possibly hard to read for a human, this little function will make our lives much easier further down the line."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"id":"UcxSUU31MS_T","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1678439905420,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":406,"user":{"displayName":"Eryk","userId":"06461886407302871561"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["class Game:\n","    @property\n","    def initial_state(self):\n","        ...\n","        return state\n","    \n","    def player(self, state):\n","        ...\n","        return playerno\n","        \n","    def actions(self, state):\n","        ...\n","        return actions\n","        \n","    def result(self, state, action):\n","        ...\n","        return new_state\n","        \n","    def is_terminal(self, state):\n","        ...\n","        return boolean\n","        \n","    def utility(self, state, player):\n","        ...        \n","        return number\n","        \n","    def print_state(self, state):\n","        ...

Analyzing the results of this experiment, we can conclude that the 8 by 8 board strongly favors the second player (the first player won only 4 times (1vs1, 2vs1, 7vs1, 5vs5)). To provide more evidence, there are two additional code cells which clash `HeuristicAlphaBeta` with `dummy` on both sides of the board (on the first table the `HeuristicAlphaBeta` is the first player). `HeuristicAlphaBeta` can easily beat `dummy` on every depth level, but struggles to breakthrough when faced with a better opponent. There is no clear pattern, the deeper alpha-beta is not guaranteed to beat the shallower one. (the above code cell takes about 11m to run (In the additional evidences is a similar table with smaller MAX_DEPTH value, which runs much faster))*"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["##ADDITIONAL EVIDENCES:"],"metadata":{"id":"sHqlU3MpPdwg"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["TAB = []\n","MAX_DEPTH = 8\n","col_names = [str(x) for x in range(1, MAX_DEPTH + 1)]\n","\n","for i in range(1, MAX_DEPTH + 1):\n","    TAB.append(judge_without_prints(MigrationWithHeuristic(8), HeuristicAlphaBeta(i), dummy))\n","df = pd.DataFrame(np.array(TAB), index=col_names, columns = ['did it beat dummy?'])\n","df = df.rename_axis(columns='depth')\n","display(df)"],"metadata":{"id":"uVXM4f-9EpGN","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1670246480895,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":44119,"user":{"displayName":"Eryk","userId":"06461886407302871561"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":300},"outputId":"231fe62c-e928-48be-d3ee-eb030c88f114"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["depth  did it beat dummy?\n","1                       1\n","2                       1\n","3                       1\n","4                       1\n","5                       1\n","6                       1\n","7                       1\n","8                       1"],"text/html":["\n","  <div id=\"df-28bef592-520f-4cc1-98ae-bc2a402cb167\">\n","    <div class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","      <div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th>depth</th>\n","      <th>did it beat dummy?</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>5</th>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>6</th>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>7</th>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>8</th>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>\n","      <button class=\"colab-df-convert\" onclick=\"convertToInteractive('df-28bef592-520f-4cc1-98ae-bc2a402cb167')\"\n","              title=\"Convert this dataframe to an interactive table.\"\n","              style=\"display:none;\">\n","        \n","  <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" height=\"24px\"viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"\n","       width=\"24px\">\n","    <path d=\"M0 0h24v24H0V0z\" fill=\"none\"/>\n","    <path d=\"M18.56 5.44l.94 2.06.94-2.06 2.06-.94-2.06-.94-.94-2.06-.94 2.06-2.06.94zm-11 1L8.5 8.5l.94-2.06 2.06-.94-2.06-.94L8.5 2.5l-.94 2.06-2.06.94zm10 10l.94 2.06.94-2.06 2.06-.94-2.06-.94-.94-2.06-.94 2.06-2.06.94z\"/><path d=\"M17.41 7.96l-1.37-1.37c-.4-.4-.92-.59-1.43-.59-.52 0-1.04.2-1.43.59L10.3 9.45l-7.72 7.72c-.78.78-.78 2.05 0 2.83L4 21.41c.39.39.9.59 1.41.59.51 0 1.02-.2 1.41-.59l7.78-7.78 2.81-2.81c.8-.78.8-2.07 0-2.86zM5.41 20L4 18.59l7.72-7.72 1.47 1.35L5.41 20z\"/>\n","  </svg>\n","      </button>\n","      \n","  <style>\n","    .colab-df-container {\n","      display:flex;\n","      flex-wrap:wrap;\n","      gap: 12px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #E8F0FE;\n","      border: none;\n","      border-radius: 50%;\n","      cursor: pointer;\n","      display: none;\n","      fill: #1967D2;\n","      height: 32px;\n","      padding: 0 0 0 0;\n","      width: 32px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #E2EBFA;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 2px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.3), 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.15);\n","      fill: #174EA6;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #3B4455;\n","      fill: #D2E3FC;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #434B5C;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);\n","      filter: drop-shadow(0px 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3));\n","      fill: #FFFFFF;\n","    }\n","  </style>\n","\n","      <script>\n","        const buttonEl =\n","          document.querySelector('#df-28bef592-520f-4cc1-98ae-bc2a402cb167 button.colab-df-convert');\n","        buttonEl.style.display =\n","          google.colab.kernel.accessAllowed ?
